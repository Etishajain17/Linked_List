/*
Suppose there is an organization which would like to propose work from home for their employees
due to covid-19 restrictions. An Employee of the organisation could possibly choose to work from
home on a first-come first-served basis, only the first 'k' employees would be allowed to work from home.
Now observe the signature of the method below and complete the following method.

public Queue allotWorkFromHome(LinkedList employees,int k){}

The method receives a singly linked list of employee types as 'employees' and the number of employees who
would be allowed to switch to work from home as 'k' as parameters. The method should take the first 'k' employees from
the linked list and put them into a queue and return the queue of employees.Only those employees should be added to the
queue whose 'workingFromHome' is already set to true in the linked list.

class Employee{
private String name,
private boolean workingFromHome
}
